Codex is a blockchain data API that provides real-time and historical token data
across 70+ networks via GraphQL, including Celo.

### What Codex offers

Codex provides a unified GraphQL API for accessing on-chain data without
running your own indexer. Developers building on Celo can query:

- **Token prices** — Real-time and historical price data for any token
- **DEX trades** — Swap events across decentralized exchanges on Celo
- **Liquidity pools** — Pool data including reserves, volume, and fees
- **Wallet activity** — Token balances and transaction history

2. Query the GraphQL endpoint at `https://graph.codex.io/graphql`
3. Set your API key in the `Authorization` header
